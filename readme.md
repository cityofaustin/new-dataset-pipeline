## Developing new open datasets at City of Austin

This space is for collaborating about open datasets that have been approved for development by the City of Austin. In this repo, each new dataset is represented by an issue. 

#### To suggest a new dataset...
please visit the repo for open-data-suggestions [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions), where we have a process for receiving and reviewing new suggestions.

#### To view datasets currently in development...
have a look at the issues section [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/new-dataset-pipeline/issues).


It's a bit experimental, as most of the collaborators are currently learning to use GitHub for the first time. 


For questions please feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/new-dataset-pipeline/issues/new) (requires login) or send an email to hailey.pate@austintexas.gov (doesn't require login).
